title: circular RNAs encoded by androgen receptor gene
---
Deregulated expression of circular RNAs (circRNAs) is associated with various human diseases, including many types of cancer. Despite their growing links to cancer, there has been limited characterization of circRNAs in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, the major cause of prostate cancer mortality. Through the analysis of an exome-capture RNA-seq dataset from 47 metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer samples and ribodepletion and RNase R RNA-sequencing of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and cell models, we identified 13 circRNAs generated from the key prostate cancer driver gene-androgen receptor (AR). We validated and characterized the top four most abundant, clinically relevant AR circRNAs.
